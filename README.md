Stata template code for generating neighborhood-level business counts from the
National Establishment Time Series (NETS) database,
by SIC industry category and geography (census tract or ZCTA).

This code supports data curation work for the
[National Neighborhood Data Archive (NaNDA)](https://nanda.isr.umich.edu/).

## About the NETS database

The National Establishment Time Series (NETS) is a proprietary longitudinal
database of United States business establishments, produced by Walls &
Associates from archival Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) establishment data. It
provides annual records on establishment location, industry (SIC
classification), and employment from 1990 onward; the vintage used for NaNDA
datasets runs through 2022.

NETS is licensed commercially and has **no public website**. The canonical
technical reference is Walls (2007), [National Establishment Time-Series
Database: Data Overview](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1022962)
(SSRN); an independent assessment is Barnatchez, Crane & Decker (2017),
[An Assessment of the NETS Database](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2017110pap.pdf)
(Federal Reserve FEDS working paper). Access inquiries go to Walls &
Associates directly; there is no self-service portal.

## What the template does

`run_make_TEMPLATE_sic4_sic6_sic8_category_GEO_counts_vDATE.do` is a driver
script. For each user-defined business category (a named set of 8-digit SIC
codes), it calls a subroutine that builds establishment counts per geographic
unit per year, then merges all category files into a single combined dataset
with one row per geography-year.

**Note:** The subroutine it calls
(`make_NETS_sic4_sic6_sic8_category_[GEO]_counts_sub.do`) and the NETS source
data are **not** included in this repository. NETS is a licensed, proprietary
database; you must have your own access to the data and the accompanying
subroutine for this driver to run.

## Usage

1. Copy the template and rename it following the pattern
   `run_make_[CATGROUP]_sic4_sic6_sic8_category_[GEO]_counts_v[DATE].do`.
2. Fill in the CONFIG block:

   | Local         | What goes there                                        |
   |---------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
   | `versiondate` | Run date, `YYYYMMDD`                                   |
   | `geo`         | Geography: `tract10`, `tract20`, `zcta10`, or `zcta20` |
   | `geoid`       | Matching ID variable, e.g. `tract_fips10`              |
   | `catgroup`    | Short name for the category group (used in filenames)  |
   | `script_dir`  | Directory containing your .do files                    |
   | `outdir`      | Directory for combined count output                    |

3. Duplicate the category block once per business category, setting `myname`
   (variable suffix), `mylabel` (human-readable label), and `sic8s`
   (space-separated 8-digit SIC codes).
4. Run the script. Logs are written to `script_dir`; the merged dataset is
   saved to `outdir`.

### Label escaping

Category labels are passed as arguments to a subroutine, so commas and
parentheses will break parsing. Use the placeholders documented in the
template header: `(comma)`, `(and)`, `(lp)`, and `(rp)`.

## Requirements

- Stata
- The `fsum` package (`ssc install fsum`)
- Licensed access to NETS data and the counts subroutine

## NaNDA datasets built from NETS

The following published NaNDA datasets are derived from NETS. Each provides
counts and densities of the named establishment type per census tract and/or
ZCTA per year. Full titles follow the pattern "National Neighborhood Data
Archive (NaNDA): [name], United States".
